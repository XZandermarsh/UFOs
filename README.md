# UFOs
## Overview
* The purpose of this project was to use a set of UFO sighting data and incorporate it into an interactive and visually pleasing website. The website was to include a filter feature to search for UFO sightings by date, city, state, country, and UFO shape.

## Results/Instructions
* Suppose someone would like to check if there were any settings in their town yesterday. To do this, they would enter yesterday's date (let's say it was 1/10/2010) nest to "Enter Date." 



* They will then type the name of their city into the city field, and hit enter. For this example let's use San Diego. 



* The results are shown in the table to the right of the search fields, and the user could get additional information about the sightings that match the criteria, such as the shape, duration, and comments related to the sighting.


## Summary/Recommended Improvements
* In conclusion, one drawback of this new design is that the user can only enter exact matches. This may not seem important for city and state, but a common use case would be to enter only a month or year, or even a range of dates. One improvement would be to allow the user to enter a start and end date, and the app would return a table of the sightings that occured in that range.
